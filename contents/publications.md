- <strong>Construction of the RAG Recall Layer for a Legal Assistance LLM</strong>, Completed at Shanghai Faqianyan Inc. Append RRF algorithm to a basic BGE_reranker. Trimmed input tokens with prompt mapping table (Prompt Engineering) for meaning completion. Finally improved LLM RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) reranking top 10 recall rate from 68% to 100% [[Code]](https://github.com/Alan-TianyaoSu/WorkSample)

- <strong>Multi-Model Integration for Marine Meteorological Forecasts</strong>, [[Paper]](https://github.com/Alan-TianyaoSu/Works/blob/main/Multimodel/Thesis/Thesis.pdf) Developed a 48-hour sea fog forecasting system for the Pacific using data from the China Oceanic Administration. Combined multiple time series analysis models and used Graph WaveNet to lower loss. Integrated XGBoost and LightGBM to predict sea fog occurrence, achieving 85% accuracy and an ROC-AUC of 0.93, surpassing previous studies' 75% accuracy.

- <strong>Offshore Areas Ulva Prolifera Identification with Remote Sensing Images</strong>, Developed an Ulva Prolifera identification system using NASA MODIS L1B 500m satellite data for optical chlorophyll detection, danger assessment, and 3-month predictions. Extracted distribution using NDVI and RVI methods, achieving 92% accuracy in coverage and concentration analysis. Predicted growth trends with the Informer neural network, achieving over 75% accuracy for 10-day occurrence predictions. [[Code]](https://github.com/Alan-TianyaoSu/Works/tree/main/Modis)
