- <strong>Construction of the RAG Recall Layer for a Legal Assistance LLM</strong>, Completed at Shanghai Faqianyan Inc. Append RRF algorithm to a basic BGE_reranker. Trimmed input tokens with prompt mapping table (Prompt Engineering) for meaning completion. Finally improved LLM RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) reranking top 10 recall rate from 68% to 100%.

- <strong>Multi-Model Integration for Marine Meteorological Forecasts</strong> [[Paper]](https://github.com/Alan-TianyaoSu/Works/blob/main/Multimodel/Thesis/Thesis.pdf). Developed a 48-hour sea fog forecasting system for the Pacific using data from the China Oceanic Administration. Combined multiple time series analysis models and used Graph WaveNet to lower loss. Integrated XGBoost and LightGBM to predict sea fog occurrence, achieving 85% accuracy and an ROC-AUC of 0.93, surpassing previous studies' 75% accuracy.

- <strong>Tomorrow.io Weather Information Query System</strong> Includes both web and Android platforms. The web platform [[Link]](https://assignment2-784518.wm.r.appspot.com/) uses Angular and Bootstrap as the front-end framework, with Node.js + Express handling back-end requests. The Android platform [[Video]](https://youtu.be/3C25_u34mEw) is built using Kotlin syntax with an embedded back-end. The system enables querying of current and future weather features through Tomorrow.io and Google Maps APIs, supporting automatic geographic location matching.

- <strong>Offshore Areas Ulva Prolifera Identification with Remote Sensing Images</strong>. Developed an Ulva Prolifera identification system using NASA MODIS L1B 500m satellite data for optical chlorophyll detection, danger assessment, and 3-month predictions. Extracted distribution using NDVI and RVI methods, achieving 92% accuracy in coverage and concentration analysis. Predicted growth trends with the Informer neural network, achieving over 75% accuracy for 10-day occurrence predictions. [[Code]](https://github.com/Alan-TianyaoSu/Works/tree/main/Modis)

- <strong>Research on Multimodal Product Recommendation System</strong>. Developed a multimodal product recommendation framework combining Item2Vec, VAE, and CLIP, utilizing 5 years of product data, including views, types, and images. Achieved 88% accuracy in product classification by embedding product features with CLIP and VAE. Enhanced Item2Vec for diverse recommendations, reaching 70% accuracy and 77% recall on the test set.
